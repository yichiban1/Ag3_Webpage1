      <h2>1. The guiding values of design and their embodiment in UI</h2>
      <div class="answer">
        <figure class="pic">
          <img src="pica1.png" alt="picture" />
          <figcaption>
            Fig1. Cao Cao's Short Song (original poem) source: Wiki
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The core design values ​​of this project are<strong>
            "Cross-language poetic experience takes precedence over instrumental
            translation"</strong
          >and<strong>
            "Guiding users to actively explore through interaction"</strong
          >. I hope that users will not passively read a translated poem, but
          gradually build a personal understanding of the sound, form and
          meaning of the poem through their own operations, like solving a
          puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
          These values ​​are reflected in the UI through the following specific
          designs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Vertical typesetting and floating animation: This is not only to
            restore and respect the original form of visual presentation of
            ancient poetry books, but also to set a small "threshold". Users
            need to adjust their reading habits slightly, and this process of
            active adaptation itself can make people pay more attention to the
            text itself. Floating animation gives static text vitality, making
            the entire poem no longer boring.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click triggers transliteration linkage: bind sound (tonejs), vision
            (color, translation) and meaning (annotation) in one or several
            clicks to create an interactive experience of "exploration". The
            user is not querying a word, but "triggering" the complete
            expression of a poem.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strict single-sentence translation display: Mandatoryly sets the
            pace for user exploration to prevent information overload. The
            mechanism requires users to understand the poem sentence by sentence
            when viewing the poem, rather than reading it quickly and hastily.
            This is consistent with the appreciation of classical poetry.
          </li>

        2. Design Concepts of UI Feedback, Information Design, Mapping, and
        Learnability
      </h2>
      <div class="answer">
        <strong>1. Feedback design</strong>
        <p>
          Instant and continuous feedback: Different changes in notes (instant)
          and colors when tapped (continuous) give the user a clear idea that
          the system has received an instruction and that the status has
          changed.
        </p>
        <p>Progressive information disclosure:</p>
        <p>
          First level (hover): The verse is displayed turning yellow, indicating
          that it is clickable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second layer (click): play notes, display translations, random color
          change.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third layer (double click): A detailed explanation of the literary
          and historical background appears at the bottom to meet the needs of
          in-depth exploration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hidden Layer (Spacebar): Toggles day and night mode, a feature that
          requires "discovery", increasing the usability and usability of the
          overall UI.
        </p>
        <strong>2. Information design </strong>
        <p>
          Clear priorities: The original Chinese poem is always the absolute
          center of vision, emphasized with large fonts and vertical rows. As an
          auxiliary comprehension tool, English translation is placed on the
          right side with small font size and horizontal layout, which is both
          clear and readable without damaging the main structure.
        </p>
        <figure class="pic">
          <img src="pica2.png" alt="picture" />
          <figcaption>Fig3. Website click event effect example</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Contextual tips: The captions at the top of the carousel are not
          simple instructions, but are interspersed with context, provenance,
          and translation statements. This does not interfere with the main
          interface, while strengthening the overall UI background while
          building a credible cultural context for the entire work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Non-modal feedback: All prompts (e.g., translations, background
          information) appear in a non-intrusive manner without interrupting the
          user's current reading flow.
        </p>

        <strong>3. Mapping and Learnability </strong>
        <p>
          Direct Action: Users tap directly on the poem they're interested in,
          rather than using an additional button or menu. This minimizes the
          interaction path and provides the most direct mapping.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consistency: The interaction pattern is identical across all poem
          lines. Once users master the first line, they can anticipate the
          behavior for the remaining lines, minimizing the learning curve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discoverability: Through visual cues (such as hover effects) and
          progressive prompts (such as "Double-click text for annotations" in
          the carousel subtitles), users are guided to discover deeper
          functionality, enhancing the sense of discovery during use.

      <h2>3. Significant Changes Since the Mid-Term Milestone</h2>
      <p>
        From the initial prototype to the final version, the project underwent a
        thorough reconstruction and upgrade, mainly focusing on four core
        dimensions: audio experience, visual system, interaction logic and
        information architecture.
      </p>
      <strong
        >1.Audio system: from basic function implementation to atmosphere
        creation
      </strong>
      <br />
      <span
        >The initial version uses the basic Tone.Synth(), which only realizes
        single-note playback, and the timbre is mechanical and the interaction
        is stiff. The final version is upgraded to a complete audio architecture
        of polyphonic synthesizer + effects chain:</span
      >

      <p>
        Support for simultaneous playback of multiple notes with Tone.PolySynth,
        ensuring smooth operation of the "Play" function Add the FeedbackDelay
        effect to create an ethereal reverberation texture that matches the
        artistic conception of the poem Adjust the detail parameters (attack:
        0.05, release: 2) to make the sound sound softer and more natural
      </p>
      <p>
        This shift reflects the evolution of the design philosophy from "with
        sound" to "with good sound", where audio is no longer a functional
        embellishment but a core component of the immersive experience.
      </p>
      <strong
        >2. Visual system: from static layout to dynamic experience
      </strong>
      <br /><span
        >The initial version featured only a basic vertical text layout, but the
        final version incorporates a complete dynamic visual language
        system:</span
      >
      <p>Multi-layered animation architecture</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Basic floating animation: Each verse floats independently, with odd
          and even rows moving at different speeds to create a sense of rhythm.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Progressive emergence: Verses fade in sequentially, avoiding abrupt
          loading.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Light columns and halos: Pseudo-elements are used to add a breathing
          light effect to each column of verses, adding visual depth.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Color and state management system</p>

      <p>
        The initial version only featured basic click-to-display translation
        functionality. The final version features a hierarchical interaction
        system
      </p>
      <span>Core Interaction (Click): </span>
      <p>
        Implements a "single-select card" translation display, ensuring strict
        interface clarity. Integrates complex feedback with audio playback,
        color changes, and halo emphasis. Adds a typewriter effect to enhance
        the ritual of translation.
      </p>
      <p>Deep Interaction (Double Click):</p>
      <p>
        Adds museum-style cultural annotations, displaying detailed historical
        context. Timed disappearance ensures a balance between information
        delivery and interface clutter.

      <h2>4. Production Timeline and Development Time Allocation</h2>
      <p>
        Weeks 6 and 7 (Laying the Foundation): Focused on overcoming technical
        challenges, namely integrating Tone.js and vertical text layout. Ensured
        the core "audio-visual integration" mechanism was operational. Week 8
        (Building the Core Experience): Implemented the complete click
        interaction logic chain: unlocking the audio context -> playing a note
        -> toggling the translation display -> recording. This was the most
        feature-intensive phase. Week 9 (Polishing and Optimization): This was
        the longest phase, focusing primarily on CSS animations and visual
        aesthetics. Adjusted the curves of the floating animation, designed the
        breathing effects of the light column and halo, and repeatedly tweaked
        the color and opacity to ensure readability and a sense of atmosphere.
        Week 10 (Functional Expansion and Refinement): Added double-click
        prompts, carousel subtitles, and day/night mode. These were "icing on
        the cake," but significantly enriched the product's content and
        completion. Weeks 11 and 12 (Testing and Finalization): browser testing
        and fixed issues such as audio overlap caused by clicking too quickly.
        Documentation was also written.
      </p>

      <figure class="pic">
        <img src="pica4.png" alt="picture" />
        <figcaption>Fig5. Timeline flowchart</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        In terms of time allocation, approximately 40% was spent on core
        functionality, 45% on visual polish and user experience optimization,
        and 15% on expanding functionality and testing. The focus of the
        project's later stages shifted from "implementing functionality" to
        "improving quality."

    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>5. The design aspect we are most proud of</h2>
      <p>
        I'm most proud of the "column theme color halo system." It's more than
        just a visual decoration. Its implementation logic is as follows: In
        CSS, a CSS variable, --colHue, is defined for each column
        (.col:nth-child(n)). The .col::after pseudo-element creates a radial
        gradient elliptical halo, whose color is bound to --colHue. In
        JavaScript, when a verse in a column is clicked, a randomly generated
        color hue is synchronized to the --colHue of its parent column element.
        This also triggers a brief zoom-in animation (col.animate). This process
        successfully transforms a click event on a single verse into a visual
        emphasis on the entire column, integrating sound, poetry, and scenery
        through color.

      <h2>6. The most challenging design aspects</h2>
      <p>
        The most challenging aspect was “seamlessly integrating English
        translations within the strict constraints of vertical layout.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This was not merely a technical issue but a design and interaction
        challenge. The difficulties lay in:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Technical layer:</strong> English text must be detached from the
        document flow using `position: absolute`, with precise calculations for
        `left: 100%` and `transform: translateY(-50%)` to position it midway to
        the right of the Chinese text. Minor positioning variations caused by
        differing English text lengths also needed handling.
      </p>
      <figure class="pic">
        <img src="pica6.png" alt="picture" />
        <figcaption>
          Fig7. Change the layout and add the first version of the carousel
          subtitles above
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <strong>Design layer:</strong> How to ensure horizontally aligned
        English text with smaller fonts doesn't appear jarring? I ultimately
        introduced a frosted glass backdrop (`background: hsla(0, 0%, 7%, 0.35);
        backdrop-filter: blur(4px);`). This detail proved crucial—it provides
        the translated text with its own textured “backing,” allowing it to
        gently emerge from the background. This ensures clarity while seamlessly
        integrating into the overall dark-toned design.
      </p>

        <figcaption>
          Fig8. To improve readability, the first version adds a focus effect
          and uses background color changes for differentiation.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <strong>Interaction Logic:</strong> Implementing the “single-selection
        card” display logic required precise management of the currentLine
        variable's state, with checks and cleanup triggered on every click. This
        formed the foundation of the entire interaction—a single error would
        have shattered the experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overcoming this challenge was precisely the process that transformed
        this project from “an idea” into “a functional interactive website.”
